Description: The R package ggplot2 provides a powerful and flexible approach to 
  data visualization, and it is suitable both for rapid exploration of different
  visualization approaches and for producing carefully crafted publication-quality
  figures. However, getting ggplot2 to make figures that look exactly the way you
  want them to can sometimes be challenging, and beginners and experts alike can
  get confused by themes, scales, coords, guides, or facets. This repository houses
  a set of step-by-step examples demonstrating how to get the most out of ggplot2,
  including how to choose and customize scales, how to theme plots, and when and
  how to use extension packages. The examples shown are based on the book "Fundamentals
  of Data Visualization" by Claus O. Wilke.
